# ZOO-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
# Problem Statement

Current zoo management tools make it difficult for visitors and care takers to quickly locate animal exhibits. This leads to frustrated visitors, wasted time, and unnecessary strain on staff who must direct guests. The lack of clear, immediate routing and contextual information reduces overall visitor satisfaction and operational efficiency.

# Proposed Solution

Develop a comprehensive Zoo Management System using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows visitors to click an animal image to instantly receive clear, step-by-step directions to the exhibit. The directions will include landmarks, signage cues, walking time estimates, and nearby amenities (restrooms, cafés, viewing platforms). The system will improve visitor experience, reduce staff interruptions, and maximize time spent enjoying exhibits.
The Zoo Management System is a streamlined platform designed to help customers explore wildlife information, check visiting schedules, and easily book or cancel tickets online. This system simplifies zoo operations by maintaining details of animals, staff, employees, and visitor activity in one place.This system enables animal lovers to search for any animal and view detailed information such as habitat, species, feeding time, and availability in the zoo. It also manages ticket reservations, cancellation processes, and booking status checks. By automating these workflows, the zoo can offer a smoother experience to visitors while reducing manual effort for staff.The system also helps zoo administrators manage employee duties, animal details, and daily operations more efficiently.
